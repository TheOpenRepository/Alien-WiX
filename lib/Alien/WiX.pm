=head1 NAME

Alien::WiX - Installing and finding Windows Installer XML (WiX)

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Alien::WiX version 0.305419.

Note that the first digit will change if the API changes 
in an incompatible manner, while the other digits change 
when the version of WiX that is installed by this module 
changes.

There is no incompatibility between 0.x and 1.x versions, however.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Alien::WiX qw(:GENERAL);

    print wix_version();
    # Prints 3.0.5419.0, usually.
    
    $version_number = wix_version_number();
    die 'WiX beta-exit build or better required, stopping' 
        if ($version_number < 4805)
    
    print wix_binary('candle'), " exists\n";
    print wix_library('WixFirewall'), " exists\n";
    
    use Alien::WiX 0.305419 qw(:ALL);
    
    print wix_bin_candle(), " exists\n";
    print wix_bin_light(), " exists\n";
    print wix_lib_wixui(), " exists\n";
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Installing this module will also install Windows Installer XML (otherwise 
known as WiX) version 3.0.5419.0, if it (or a later version) has not 
already been installed.

This module provides utility subroutines that would be useful for programs
that use WiX to create Windows Installer (.msi) installation packages.

=head1 INTERFACE 

All routines will C<croak> when errors occur.
C<use>ing the module will also croak if WiX is not installed.

=head2 wix_version

Returns the version of Windows Installer XML (i.e. 3.0.5419.0) as a string.

=head2 wix_version_number

Returns the third portion of the version of Windows Installer XML 
(i.e. if wix_version returns 3.0.5419.0, this returns 5419) as a number.

=head2 wix_binary

Returns the location of the WiX program specified as its first parameter.
The '.exe' part is not required.

=head2 wix_library

Returns the location of the WiX extension library specified as its first parameter.
The 'Extension.dll' part is not required.

=head2 wix_bin_candle, wix_bin_light

Returns the location of candle.exe or light.exe.

=head2 wix_lib_wixui

Returns the location of the WixUI extension library.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 

=item C<< Windows Installer XML not installed, cannot continue >>

The module could not find the registry key for WiX 3.0.

=item C<< Cannot execute %s >>

The file wix_binary or a wix_bin routine was attempting to find 
could not be found or it could not be executed.

=item C<< Cannot find %s >>

The file wix_library or a wix_lib routine was attempting to find 
could not be found.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
  
Alien::WiX requires no configuration files or environment variables.

It checks the registry entries that WiX's installer wrote to the
Windows registry to get its return values.

Note that this module checks if Windows Installer XML is INSTALLED, NOT 
that it successfully executes.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This module requires Perl 5.6.0.

Non-core perl modules required are L<Win32API::Registry>
(which is required to be installed in order to run the 
Makefile.PL or Build.PL successfully), L<Module::Build> 
(which is required to install this module), 
L<Win32::TieRegistry>, L<version>, and L<Readonly>.

Installation of Alien::WiX will install Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP1 
and Windows Installer XML 3.0.5419.0 by downloading them from the 
appropriate sites unless otherwise specified.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

If you want to install WiX in a non-default location, you will want to install 
it yourself before installing this module.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-Alien-WiX@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
