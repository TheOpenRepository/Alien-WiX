=head1 NAME

Alien::WiX::Version30 - Implements the Alien::WiX interface.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Alien::WiX::Version30 version 5419.0.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Alien::WiX qw(:GENERAL);
	...
	
	# If we specifically want to rely on a 3.0.x version of WiX,
	# then do this:
    use Alien::WiX::Version30 qw(:GENERAL);
	...
	
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Installing this module will also install Windows Installer XML (otherwise 
known as WiX) version 3.0.5419.0, if it (or a later version) has not 
already been installed.

This module provides utility subroutines that would be useful for programs
that use WiX to create Windows Installer (.msi) installation packages.

=head1 INTERFACE 

This module implements the interface documented for L<Alien::WiX|Alien::WiX>.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

If you want to install WiX in a non-default location, you will want to install 
it yourself before installing this module.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-Alien-WiX@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
